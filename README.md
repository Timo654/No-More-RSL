# No-More-RSL
An unpacker/repacker for Grasshopper Manufacture .RSL format.

It should work with most if not all Grasshopper Manufacture games using this format. 


## Usage
I know a lot of modders out there don't have much patience, so using this tool is quite simple.

### Unpacking
Just drag and drop the `.rsl` file(s) onto the `rslExtract.exe` or Python script. As simple as that! You can also use `--no-recurse` to disable recursively unpacking .RSL files.


### Repacking
To repack, drag the folder(s) onto the `rslPack.exe`. You can also use `--overwrite` to automatically overwrite original .RSL file if it exists.
