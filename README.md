# No-More-RSL
An unpacker/repacker for No More Heroes .RSL format.

This has only been tested on the No More Heroes 1 and 2 PC and Wii versions, but it might work on other Grasshopper Manufacture titles.


## Usage
I know a lot of modders out there don't have much patience, so using this tool is quite simple.

### Unpacking
Just drag and drop the `.rsl` file(s) onto the `rslExtract.exe` or Python script! As simple as that.


### Repacking
To repack, drag the folder(s) onto the `rslPack.exe`
